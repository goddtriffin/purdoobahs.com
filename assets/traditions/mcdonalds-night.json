  "description": "Band camp initially starts as a team-building retreat for the Section Leaders, followed by a few days of actual camp for just the incoming new-marchers. The night before the returners join the newcomers, every purdoobah on campus (currently marching or not) meets up at McDonald's, fills up the room, and go around one-by-one telling each other their nicknames and their background story. It's a great way for the newbies to meet the upperclassmen and break the ice!"
