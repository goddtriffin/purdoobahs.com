  "name": "Slider Day",
  "description": "Every homecoming football game, all Purdoobahs gather in the basement of Elliot Hall of Music to partake in this tradition. Second year marchers in the section supply massive amounts of White Castle Sliders (usually between 300 and 450). Tradition states that the smallest member of the section announces a recommended number of sliders for each section member to eat. Over the years, recommendations have ranged from 8 to 14 sliders to be eaten that morning! We do this as we're getting ready for the gameday - so it isn't unusual for this to happen around 4am some years!"
