  "description": "After every touchdown, the purdoobahs raise their toobahs above their heads and basically do an incline bench press - 1 for every point we've scored so far in the game! The first touchdown is 7, the second is 14, etc. During the Ohio State vs Purdue football game on October 20th, 2018 where we won 49-20, the section did a total of 196 Toobah Push-ups - per Purdoobah! That's over 4,200 Toobah Push-ups from the entire section!"
