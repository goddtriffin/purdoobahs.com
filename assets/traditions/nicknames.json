  "name": "Nicknames",
  "description": "Every member of the section gets a nickname. Even some that end up transitioning to indoor ensembles. A nickname comes from a funny story from your past (of your choosing), or for something funny that happened during band camp. Nicknames are only given from upperclassmen who have marched at least 1 year, with the deciding vote going to the most veteran members and general consensus of the section. If you don't like a nickname that you may receive you can of course veto it. You aren't forced to do anything in the section that you don't want to - hazing is strictly forbidden and not tolerated in any form."
