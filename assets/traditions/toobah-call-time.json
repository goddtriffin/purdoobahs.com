  "name": "Toobah Call Time",
  "description": "Purdoobahs have a lot to do prior to the start of a game day (polishing their bits, dressing in uniform, organizing flip book, perform traditions like Moskau, etc). In order to facilitate group success, the Section Leader sets a call time for the section at the end of the prior Gold Day. The call time is usually announced like so: \"Sisters and Brothers of YMSH, your Toobah Call Time for tomorrow is 4:69.69 AM\" (aka 5:10am + 9 seconds)."
